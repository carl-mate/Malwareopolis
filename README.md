# Malwareopolis
Malwareopolis is a pixel-art-themed game bundle set in a dystopian city that includes three mini-games that represent the districts: (1) Malware Alley (Are you smarter than a 5th grader Variant), (2) Rampage District (Plants vs Zombies Variant), and (3) Ground Zero (Atari Breakout Arcade Variant). 

The player's primary goal is to destroy the different bosses that rule each district and reach a minimum quota to unlock the next district. The player's achieved quota reflects in a 3-star rating system where three stars mean "excellent", two stars mean "good", one star means "mediocre" (i.e., the minimum quota), and no star means "try again". 

Each district has a different set of game mechanics. The player begins his/her journey at Malware Alley (Are you smarter than a 5th grader Variant), where he/she must answer a set of questions to deal damage to the boss and defeat him. The next stop is Rampage District (Plants Vs Zombies Variant), where the player must put his/her strategic skills to the test in order to beat the boss by first enduring three waves of attacks from his malware minions who will try to go past the border and expand their territory into the rest of the city. Finally, Ground Zero (Atari Breakout Arcade Variant) is where the player must put his reflexes to the test to destroy the rectangular malware blocks that protect the final boss who is plotting to destroy the entire Malwareopolis then get the chance to defeat him and win the game.
